                <p class="quote">My name is Inna Arabejo. I got interested in computer science 4 years ago when I attended a Women Who
                    Code meetup. I didn't know what specific career of computer science I was going to pursue, but I
                    knew coding was my niche. When I heard about web development, it thrilled me of the endless
                    possibilities of creating a web page that I could proudly call my own. All with the use of my handy
                    brain and computer. So here I am embarking in my own boundless journey of learning and developing
                    with fellow developers alike.</p>

                <p class="quote-reverse">I have always been the go-to person in my family to fix computer hardware issues and solve mysteries
                    of "why the internet went out". I decided that it was time I get paid to render services to those in
                    need for professional help. Working in the corporate world in my short time so far, it is clear that
                    there is a need to keep evolving. I started learning more on my own the intricacies of demystifying
                    technology to those in need of it. I dived headlong into technology and never looked back and hope
                    to continue to grow my skills to help those in need.</p>

                <p class="quote">Web Developer, graphic designer, and musician creating dynamic web applications. Currently attending
                    SMU to develop skills in MERN with newly acquired knowledge of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
                    through the Odin Project. My goal is to create unique web applications that represent creatives’
                    and/or companies’ personality and vision. Additionally, I have been commissioned by musicians,
                    podcasters, comedians, houses of worship, and small businesses throughout Texas for graphic design.
                    I’m excited to take the next step in programming that will offer a world of new opportunities in
                    creative web design.
